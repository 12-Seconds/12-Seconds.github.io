* Intro

Welcome. Here you can read my random posts which barely ever get uploaded. You can also see how I use Emacs, NixOS, and AwesomeWM, if I ever get around to writing an article about each of them.

* Links

I'm on various places on the internet. I procrastinate a lot. You can find me on [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUs99naenQw3RQxx1Rv-lNg][Youtube]], [[https://github.com/mcotocel][Github]], and some other places I don't feel like sharing. They're easy enough to find with a Google search. If you want to contact me, feel free to [[mailto:mcotocel@outlook.com][email me]].
